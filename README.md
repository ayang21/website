# Personal Portfolio :scroll:
> Welcome to my Personal Website. I plan on slowly improving the responsiveness and look of the website, but for now this is what I have deployed. If there are any improvements or suggestions, do not be afraid to open an issue with your idea!

## Sections :bookmark_tabs:
:page_facing_up: Home\
:page_facing_up: About me\
:page_facing_up: Contact \

## Tools Used :hammer_and_wrench:
* [<b>Netlify</b>](https://www.netlify.com/) - To host my website (HTML, CSS, JS, React).
* [<b>Vanta.js</b>](https://www.vantajs.com/) - A JS framework that uses Three.js to create the responsive background.
